When present, the file 'OPT_SKIP_SERIALIZING.txt' instructs AMUMSS to skip the creation
of the SerializedScript.lua file after the User script is loaded but before processing begins,
thus reducing the time needed to start executing scripts.

However, note that the SerializedScript.lua file can be a valuable tool for the modder developping
a complex script as it shows what the AMUMSS engine sees of their script.

To disable, just rename the file (I use 'x' in front of the name)
